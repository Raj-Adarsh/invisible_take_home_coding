# AI-Driven Development Test: Banking REST Service

## Overview
You are tasked with developing a REST service that a bank would use. To complete the test in a short amount of time, you MUST use AI-driven development practices. This assessment evaluates your ability to leverage AI tools effectively to design and implement a banking service.

## Project Requirements

### Core Components
You must develop the following three components:

1. **Service Interface**
   - Signing up
   - Authentication
   - Account Holders
   - Accounts
   - Transactions
   - Money Transfer
   - Cards
   - Statements

2. **Database**
   - Database implementation
   - Type safety guardrails
   - Index design
   - Scalability
   - Proper transaction design
   - Security best practices

3. **Infrastructure Definitions**
   - Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
   - Resiliency design
   - Secrets management
   - Monitoring and logging configuration

### Technology Stack
Your choices of technologies will be judged against the nature of the application and how effective those technologies are in modern software development ecosystems

### Getting Started
1. Begin development using your AI tools of choice

## Deliverables

1. **Source Code**
   - All three components (service, database, infrastructure) in separate directories
   - Tests for critical functionality
   - Configuration files

2. **Documentation**
   - SOLUTION.md with setup instructions
   - API documentation
   - Architecture diagram
   - Security considerations document

3. **AI Usage Report**
   - Tools used (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)
   - Example prompts and iterations
   - Challenges faced and how AI helped solve them
   - Areas where manual intervention was necessary

4. **Demo**
   - Video walkthrough
   - Test client application demonstrating the flow

## Ways of Working
1. Commit regularly with meaningful messages
2. Include your AI usage log as a Markdown file

## Additional Notes
- You MUST use any AI tools available to you
- External libraries and frameworks are allowed
- Focus on demonstrating effective AI-driven development
- Partial implementations are acceptable if well-documented
- Security is paramount - ensure no secrets are committed
