# Invisible Coding Test

Welcome Adarsh Raj! This repository contains your coding test.

## Test Information

- **Candidate:** Adarsh Raj
- **Email:** adarsh_raj@hotmail.com
- **GitHub ID:** Raj-Adarsh 
- **Scheduled:** 2025-10-24T20:30:00.000Z
- **Duration:** 60 minutes

## Instructions

- When the test starts a INSTRUCTIONS.md will be added to the repository
- INSTRUCTIONS.md will describe the solution you will develop

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

### Code Quality

Clean, readable, and maintainable code with proper naming conventions, comments, and structure

Evaluate the code quality based on the following criteria:

1. **Code Organization** (25 points)
   - Is the code well-structured with clear separation of concerns?
   - Are files and folders organized logically?
   - Is there appropriate use of modules/components?

2. **Naming Conventions** (25 points)
   - Are variable, function, and class names descriptive and meaningful?
   - Do they follow consistent naming patterns (camelCase, PascalCase, etc.)?
   - Are abbreviations avoided where possible?

3. **Code Readability** (25 points)
   - Is the code easy to understand without extensive comments?
   - Are complex logic sections well-commented?
   - Is there appropriate use of whitespace and formatting?

4. **Best Practices** (25 points)
   - Does the code follow language-specific best practices?
   - Are there any anti-patterns or code smells?
   - Is the code DRY (Don&#x27;t Repeat Yourself)?

Provide specific examples from the code to support your evaluation.

### Functionality

All requirements met, edge cases handled, no critical bugs, and good performance

Evaluate the functionality based on the following criteria:

1. **Requirements Completion** (40 points)
   - Are all specified requirements in INSTRUCTIONS.md implemented?
   - Does the solution work as expected?
   - List any missing requirements.

2. **Edge Case Handling** (30 points)
   - How well does the code handle edge cases?
   - Are error scenarios properly managed?
   - Is input validation implemented?

3. **Performance** (30 points)
   - Is the solution efficient in terms of time and space complexity?
   - Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks?
   - Could the solution handle larger datasets?

Test the code with various inputs and document any issues found.

### Testing

Comprehensive test coverage, tests pass successfully, good test organization

Evaluate the testing approach based on the following criteria:

1. **Test Coverage** (40 points)
   - What percentage of the code is covered by tests?
   - Are critical paths and functions tested?
   - Are both positive and negative test cases included?

2. **Test Quality** (30 points)
   - Are tests well-written and easy to understand?
   - Do tests actually verify the expected behavior?
   - Are test assertions meaningful?

3. **Test Organization** (30 points)
   - Are tests organized logically?
   - Is there a good balance between unit and integration tests?
   - Are test utilities and helpers used effectively?

Run all tests and report on pass/fail status and any issues.

### Documentation

Clear README, setup instructions, design decisions explained, and inline documentation

Evaluate the documentation based on the following criteria:

1. **SOLUTION Quality** (30 points)
   - Is there a comprehensive SOLUTION file?
   - Are setup and installation instructions clear?
   - Is the project purpose and usage well-explained?

2. **Code Documentation** (20 points)
   - Are complex functions and classes documented?
   - Are API endpoints or interfaces documented?
   - Is the documentation accurate and up-to-date?

3. **Design Decisions** (20 points)
   - Are architectural decisions explained?
   - Is the reasoning behind technology choices documented?
   - Are the technology choices consistent with modern software development practices?
   - Are any trade-offs or limitations mentioned?

4. **Demonstration** (30 points)
   - Is there a video demonstration?

Assess whether a new developer could understand and contribute to the project based on the documentation.
